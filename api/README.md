# API Scripts

Each subdirectory contains example code and snippets for interacting with the UpGuard Core API with different programming languages.

The `archive` directory contains older code that may still work, but likely will require some modification.

Refer to [UpGuard Support](https://support.upguard.com) if you need assistance with these scripts.
