Test scripts:
3.5-7
Test for 3.6 and 3.7 are same as 3.5. Just use other accounts retrived from the query.
a) select * from sys.dm_server_services
b) net localgroup Administrators "NT Service\MSSQLSERVER" /add
c) net localgroup Administrators "NT Service\MSSQLSERVER" /delete
d) net localgroup Administrators
I can not prepare test cript for "Query LocalSystem account (aka NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) used for the MSSQL service"
because it requires new installation of MS SQL Server with other configuration steps.

3.8
The check is changed (Measure-object + Count=0)

-- The way to add rows in the query result:
grant ALTER ANY DATABASE to public
go
grant CREATE ANY DATABASE to public
go

3.9 
The check is changed (Measure-object + Count=0)
You already (default configuration) have one row here. It's enough for testing.

3.10
The check is changed (Measure-object + Count=0)

-- The way to add rows in the query result:
-- 1. create localgroup in the command line
PS C:\Users\Administrator> net localgroup test_group /add

-- 2. create logon for this group
use [master]
go
CREATE LOGIN  "EC2AMAZ-ULB4L5F\test_group" FROM WINDOWS;
GO

3.11
The check is changed (Measure-object + Count=0)
-- The way to add rows in the query result:
USE msdb ;
GO
-- already created
--create CREDENTIAL CredentialForEKMq
--WITH IDENTITY='NT Service\SQLSERVERAGENT'
[[GO

EXEC dbo.sp_add_proxy
    @proxy_name = 'Catalog application proxy 3',
    @enabled = 1,
    @description = 'Maintenance tasks on catalog application.',
    @credential_name = 'CredentialForEKMq' ;

EXEC dbo.sp_grant_login_to_proxy @msdb_role = N'public', @proxy_name =N'Catalog application proxy 3';
